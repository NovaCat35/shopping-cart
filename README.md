## Goal and Challenges üî•

I am going into this project to fully solidify React concepts of using hooks, contexts, routers, and adding key features such as filtering, pagination nav, search, and other easy access tools.

Some issues that came up was connecting the search logic with the shop filter logic. While I had discovered helpful hooks like useSearchParams that will allow me to query the url and retrieve info from it, that also meant my filter would reset each time. Ultimately I was able to connect the two logic with using a context that allows both components to better flow logically and hide abstractions.

...I'll add more to this section as I progress on with this project.
