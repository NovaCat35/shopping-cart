# Shopping Cart [Ahola Awesome Store]

Ahola! This is a demo e-commerce website. The goal of this project is to utilize newly learned concepts and best practices such as react routes, testing frameworks, type checking, and api data fetching.

## Build With 🛠️

- React + Vite
- TypeScript
- SCSS module and tailwind

## Goal and Challenges 🔥
I am going into this project to fully solidify React concepts of using hooks, contexts, routers, and adding key features such as filtering, pagination nav, search, and other easy access tools. 

Originally had issue connecting the search logic with the shop logic. I had discover helpful hooks like useSearchParams that will allow me to query the url and retrieve info from it

...I'll add more to this section as I progress on with this project.

   npm install uuidv4
   npm install --save prop-types
   npm install react-router-dom
